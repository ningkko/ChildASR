*CHI:	one .
*FAT:	in January Kipper took a picture with his new camera and made a New
	Year Resolution .
*FAT:	this year I will not throw any snowballs at Tiger .
*FAT:	and for a whole month he kept his promise .
*FAT:	because the snow did not fall until February .
*FAT:	an icicle grew on Kipper's house .
*FAT:	it lasted for three weeks and grew to eighty seven centimetres .
*FAT:	Kipper took a photograph .
*FAT:	see the icicle ?
*FAT:	in March the wind flapped Kipper's ears .
*FAT:	it straightened his scarf and scruffled the daffodils on Big Hill .
*FAT:	then it blew Tiger right off his feet .
*FAT:	click .
*FAT:	this is the picture Kipper took .
*FAT:	do you see the picture ?
*CHI:	oh yeah .
*FAT:	soon the pond in the park was full of croaking and wriggling and
	glooping and jiggling .
*FAT:	March is the froggiest month said Kipper .
*FAT:	but April is best for catching tadpoles .
*FAT:	do you see the frogs and tadpoles ?
*CHI:	where (i)s the tadpoles ?
*FAT:	in the jar .
*CHI:	oh yeah .
*FAT:	by May there was blossom on the pavements thick enough to kick and
	three ducklings in the park .
*FAT:	one of them followed Tiger everywhere .
*FAT:	quack quack click !
*FAT:	the picture .
*FAT:	in June Kipper lay on his back and watched as little things
	with legs and wings climbed the spindly grasses and whizzed into
	the big blue sky .
*FAT:	there are a lot more little things with legs and wings than you
	would think thought Kipper .
*CHI:	why is he running away ?
*FAT:	looks like a bee is chasing him .
*CHI:	oh .
*CHI:	and who took that picture ?
*FAT:	I (a)m guessing Tiger did .
*FAT:	right there .
*FAT:	no Kipper sorry .
*CHI:	where is there ?
*FAT:	he [//] I think he (i)s playing with his camera .
*CHI:	why did they take a picture ?
*FAT:	because he has his camera and he (i)s taking pictures you know the
	way you take pictures with your camera .
*CHI:	but my camera (i)s gone and it run out of batteries .
*FAT:	that (i)s okay we (wi)ll charge it .
*FAT:	the first week in July was hot .
*FAT:	the second week was hotter still and then boom
	boom boom .
*FAT:	a thunderstorm .
*CHI:	and where did the thunderstorm come from ?
*FAT:	from the clouds .
*FAT:	see when it (i)s raining very heavy ?
*FAT:	remember like there was a while ago thunder and lightning ?
*FAT:	August was summer holiday time .
*FAT:	Kipper took a parachute ride above the sea .
*FAT:	take my picture he called to Tiger .
*FAT:	can you see the picture ?
*CHI:	yeah .
*FAT:	in September the bramble bushes were full of blackberries .
*FAT:	the thorns were prickly .
*FAT:	ouch ouch .
*FAT:	but the blackberries were delicious .
*FAT:	mmm .
*FAT:	picture of everything covered all in the black [/] blackberry juice .
*FAT:	in October Kipper and Tiger made a collection of autumn
	things .
*FAT:	October is orangey brown sort of month said Tiger .
*FAT:	they made a face from the pumpkin which glowed in the dark .
*FAT:	and they (ha)ve conkers .
*FAT:	remember I showed you conkers ?
*CHI:	where conkers ?
*FAT:	remember we went out looking for them up in the trees ?
*CHI:	but they have eyes .
*FAT:	they do n(o)t have eyes .
*CHI:	they do .
*FAT:	they (a)re it (i)s like a nut .
*CHI:	where (i)s that ?
*FAT:	that (i)s remember we went out looking in the grass and they were all
	open and they were prickly .
*FAT:	and then they had the conker that came outside them .
*FAT:	chestnut .
*FAT:	November came around and twiggy branches made patterns against the misty moon .
*FAT:	they huffed their breath into the heavy garden air seeing who could
	huff the highest .
*FAT:	when it (i)s cold they can see their breath .
*FAT:	can you see the picture ?
*FAT:	in December the days grew dark and cold .
*FAT:	Kipper stayed indoors making decorations and a special Christmas
	present for Tiger .
*FAT:	I need one more photograph said Kipper so he called Tiger
	and got out his camera .
*FAT:	smile said Kipper as he opened the front door .
*FAT:	but Tiger was already smiling because it was snowing and he
	had not forgotten about February .
*FAT:	click went Kipper's camera .
*FAT:	boof went Tiger's snowball .
*CHI:	then what happened ?
*FAT:	Christmas day came and Kipper gave Tiger his present .
*FAT:	look at me in August said Kipper .
*FAT:	but Tiger was looking at December .
*FAT:	this one is the best he said .
*FAT:	see him throwing the snowballs and all the pictures they took all
	through over the year .
*FAT:	now the end .
